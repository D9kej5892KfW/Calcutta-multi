{service="claude-telemetry"} |~ "(?i)security|violation|unauthorized"

# Performance metrics
{service="claude-telemetry"} | json | duration > 1000
```

**Advanced Analytics Queries**
```logql
# Error rate calculation
sum(rate({service="claude-telemetry"} |~ "error"[5m])) / 
sum(rate({service="claude-telemetry"}[5m])) * 100

# Tool usage ranking
topk(10, sum by (tool_name) (count_over_time({service="claude-telemetry"} | json | tool_name != ""[1h])))

# Session duration analysis
histogram_quantile(0.95, 
  sum(rate({service="claude-telemetry"} | json | session_duration_bucket[5m])) by (le)
)
```
