# Phase 6: Advanced Analytics Implementation Plan

## Overview
Phase 6 will implement advanced analytics capabilities on top of the existing telemetry infrastructure to provide:
- Real-time alerting for security violations
- Machine learning for anomaly detection  
- Risk scoring and behavioral baselines
- Integration with external security tools (SIEM)

## Current Foundation Analysis
✅ **Strong Foundation Available:**
- 18,076+ telemetry entries with comprehensive tool coverage
- Rich data schema with SuperClaude context, session correlation, file changes
- Operational Loki + Grafana infrastructure 
- Project-scoped security boundary detection
- Real-time performance dashboard with LogQL queries

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 6.1: Enhanced Security Alerting
**Components to Build:**
1. **Alert Rules Engine** (`scripts/alert-engine.py`)
   - Real-time log monitoring with configurable rules
   - Security violation detection (outside scope, suspicious patterns)
   - Threshold-based alerting for anomalous behavior
   
2. **Alert Configuration** (`config/alerts/security-rules.yaml`)
   - Predefined security patterns and thresholds
   - Configurable severity levels and notification channels
   - Custom rule definitions for behavioral anomalies

3. **Notification System** 
   - Email, Slack, webhook integrations
   - Alert escalation and de-duplication
   - Dashboard integration for alert visualization

### Phase 6.2: Behavioral Analytics & ML
**Components to Build:**
1. **Data Processing Pipeline** (`scripts/analytics/data-processor.py`)
   - Extract features from telemetry data (tool sequences, timing patterns, file access patterns)
   - Time-series analysis of session behaviors
   - Statistical profiling of normal vs anomalous activities

2. **Anomaly Detection Models** (`scripts/analytics/anomaly-detector.py`)
   - Unsupervised ML models (Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor)
   - Session-based behavioral fingerprinting
   - Risk scoring algorithms with confidence intervals

3. **Enhanced Analytics Dashboard** 
   - New Grafana dashboard with ML insights
   - Risk score visualizations and trend analysis
   - Behavioral pattern recognition displays

### Phase 6.3: Risk Scoring & Baselines
**Components to Build:**
1. **Baseline Profiler** (`scripts/analytics/baseline-builder.py`)
   - Historical data analysis for normal behavior patterns
   - Dynamic baseline updates with drift detection
   - Per-project and per-user behavioral profiles

2. **Risk Scoring Engine** (`scripts/analytics/risk-scorer.py`)
   - Multi-factor risk assessment (scope violations, tool usage, timing)
   - Dynamic risk thresholds based on context
   - Risk history tracking and trending

### Phase 6.4: SIEM Integration
**Components to Build:**
1. **SIEM Exporters** (`scripts/siem/`)
   - Common Event Format (CEF) exporter
   - STIX/TAXII threat intelligence integration
   - Syslog/JSON log forwarding capabilities

2. **API Integration Layer** (`scripts/api/telemetry-api.py`)
   - REST API for external tool integration
   - Authentication and authorization framework
   - Rate limiting and audit logging

## Technical Implementation Details

### New Dependencies
- **Python Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, pyyaml, requests
- **Alert Channels**: smtplib (email), slack-sdk, webhooks
- **ML Models**: joblib for model persistence, matplotlib for visualizations

### Integration Points
- **Loki Integration**: New LogQL queries for analytics data extraction
- **Grafana Enhancement**: Additional dashboards with ML visualizations  
- **Hook Enhancement**: Risk scoring integration in telemetry collection
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for external tool integration

## Success Criteria
1. **Real-time Alerting**: <30 second detection and alert delivery for security violations
2. **Anomaly Detection**: >90% accuracy in identifying abnormal behavior patterns
3. **Risk Scoring**: Comprehensive risk assessment with confidence intervals
4. **SIEM Integration**: Standards-compliant export formats for major SIEM platforms
5. **Performance**: <5% impact on existing telemetry collection performance

## Rollout Strategy
1. **Phase 6.1** (Week 1): Security alerting and notification system
2. **Phase 6.2** (Week 2): ML-based anomaly detection and behavioral analytics  
3. **Phase 6.3** (Week 3): Risk scoring and baseline profiling
4. **Phase 6.4** (Week 4): SIEM integration and external tool APIs

## Implementation Notes
This plan builds incrementally on the existing infrastructure while adding sophisticated analytics capabilities for advanced security monitoring and threat detection.

### Prerequisites
- Existing Phases 1-5 must be operational
- Python 3.8+ environment with pip
- Sufficient storage for ML models and historical data
- Network access for external integrations (SIEM, notifications)

### Risk Mitigation
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Comprehensive testing on historical data
- Performance monitoring during implementation
- Rollback procedures for each sub-phase
