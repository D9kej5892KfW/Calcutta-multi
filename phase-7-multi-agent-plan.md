# Phase 7: Multi-Agent Workflow Telemetry Implementation Plan

## Overview
Phase 7 extends the Claude Agent Telemetry system to provide comprehensive multi-agent workflow tracking, orchestration analytics, and delegation pattern intelligence. This builds on Phase 6's security and analytics foundation to enable deep visibility into complex agent collaboration patterns.

## Current Multi-Agent Foundation Analysis
✅ **Basic Sub-Agent Detection Available:**
- Task tool delegation events (`sub_agent_delegation`)
- SubAgent type tracking (`subagent_type` parameter)
- SuperClaude command detection (`/spawn`, `/task` workflows)
- Session correlation for parent-child relationship basics

❌ **Missing Multi-Agent Capabilities:**
- Agent hierarchy visualization and relationship mapping
- Cross-agent session correlation and workflow tracking
- Delegation pattern analytics and performance measurement
- Agent coordination efficiency metrics
- Resource distribution and load balancing insights

## Multi-Agent Workflow Architecture

### Agent Relationship Types
1. **Parent-Child Delegation**: Primary agent spawns sub-agents via Task tool
2. **Peer Collaboration**: Multiple agents working on related tasks simultaneously  
3. **Sequential Handoff**: Agent A completes → Agent B continues workflow
4. **Orchestration**: Master agent coordinates multiple specialized sub-agents

### Multi-Agent Data Schema Extensions

#### Enhanced Agent Context
```json
{
  "agent_context": {
    "agent_id": "uuid-primary-agent",
    "parent_agent_id": "uuid-parent-agent", 
    "agent_hierarchy_level": 2,
    "agent_specialization": "general-purpose|frontend|backend|security",
    "delegation_strategy": "parallel|sequential|hierarchical",
    "workflow_orchestration": "wave|sub-agent|loop|single"
  },
  "delegation_metadata": {
    "delegation_reason": "complexity|scope|specialization|performance",
    "expected_outcome": "analysis|implementation|validation|coordination",
    "resource_allocation": "high|medium|low",
